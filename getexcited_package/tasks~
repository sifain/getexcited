TASKS:

Urgent
1) check to make sure rseedslist prints for restart.py
2) check problem with TSMAX

Less Urgent
1) how to simulate pump-push-probe spectroscopy, possible convolution?
2) push pulse data must come from coords.xyz, coordinate.out, velocity.out, and coeff-n.out - this is to be able use same ensemble data for different pump-push delay times
